	Building a scalable and highly available WordPress website on AWS
○	Built and deployed a WordPress website on AWS using Terraform to automate the infrastructure provisioning process, resulting in a scalable and highly available website that can handle high traffic loads.
○	Utilized AWS services such as RDS, Secrets Manager, Auto Scaling, Load Balancer, Route53, and Amazon Certificate Manager to ensure the security and availability of the website.
○	Implemented a database solution using RDS to store site data securely and efficiently and used Secrets Manager to manage the database password securely.
○	Set up Auto Scaling to provision multiple servers in HA mode, ensuring that the website can handle unexpected spikes in traffic and maintain high availability.
○	Configured user-data scripts to install WordPress on the servers and ensure that they are ready to handle traffic as soon as they are launched.
○	Implemented a Load Balancer to distribute incoming requests across multiple web servers, improving the website's response time and reducing the risk of downtime.
○	Utilized Route53 and Amazon Certificate Manager to connect to the website securely via user-friendly DNS names and ensure that traffic is encrypted using SSL/TLS.
○	Created clear and concise architecture diagrams that describe the solution, including a networking diagram, security group layout, and user request flow diagram, making it easy to understand the solution during a potential interview.
○	Conducted testing and troubleshooting to identify and resolve any issues or vulnerabilities in the infrastructure and application, ensuring that the website is secure and reliable.
